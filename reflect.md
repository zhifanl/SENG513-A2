## Reflecting on the Implementation Process

### What I Learned

- During the implementation of the game, I learned a lot about web development, especially in the context of building interactive web applications and games. I gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as animation and user interaction.

### Challenges

- Managing the game's complexity was a significant challenge. As the game progressed, the speed of the cars and obstacles increased, which required careful design and coding to ensure smooth and challenging gameplay without overwhelming the players.
- Implementing custom collision detection was another challenge. Ensuring that the game correctly detected collisions between the cars and obstacles while maintaining performance was a complex task.

### Managing Game Complexity

- To manage the game's complexity, I carefully organized the code into distinct functions and modules. I separated the game logic, animation, and user interaction into different sections to make the code more manageable.
- I used CSS transitions and animations to handle the smooth movement of cars and obstacles, making the code more elegant and easier to maintain.
- I implemented a scoring system that increased the score as players successfully avoided obstacles, adding a competitive element to the game.

### Comparison to Initial Concept

- The final product closely resembles the initial concept outlined in the game overview and design. The core mechanics, including car movement, obstacle avoidance, and the scoring system, remained consistent with the initial plan.
- The visual design, including the layout, cars, obstacles, and UI elements, matched the initial design concepts.
- However, there were some minor adjustments and refinements during the development process to ensure the game's playability and aesthetics.

### Summary

- In summary, the implementation of the car racing game was a valuable learning experience. It required overcoming challenges related to complexity and custom game mechanics while staying true to the initial concept. The final product achieved the intended gameplay and visual design, providing an engaging and competitive two-player gaming experience.
