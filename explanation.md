### Explanation of three complex functions

1. updateGame function:

    - The updateGame function manages the game's progression for each player. It checks whether the game has started and whether the player's game is not over. If conditions are met, it calls the moveObstacle function to update the position of obstacles, checks for collisions using the checkCollision function, and increases the game speed gradually. This function handles the core game mechanics and ensures that the game's difficulty increases over time. It also relies on the use of complex conditional statements and calculations.

2. checkCollision function:

    - The checkCollision function is responsible for detecting collisions between the player's cars and the obstacles. It contains complex collision logic for both player 1 and player 2. The function checks if the car's position overlaps with the obstacle's position in both horizontal and vertical directions. If a collision is detected, the game over state is triggered for the respective player. When both players' games are over, the function sorts the players by their scores and displays an alert message indicating the winner and second place.

3. startGame function:
    - The startGame function is responsible for initiating the game. When the start button is clicked, it sets gameStarted to true, hides the start button, and calls the initObstacles function to initialize the obstacle positions. It then sets up two separate intervals for updating the game for each player, calling the updateGame function for player1 and player2. This function handles the game's startup and ensures that both players' games are running simultaneously.
