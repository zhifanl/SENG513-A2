## GAME OVERVIEW

**Target Platform**: This game is designed for laptops with two players.

**Game Genre**: Car racing, collision avoidance, 2 players, retro game.

### Game Objective
- The primary goal of players is to avoid colliding with obstacles.
- The player with the highest score wins.
- As the game progresses, the car speed increases.

### Rules of the Game
- Players need to click the Start button to begin the game.
- Player 1 controls the red car with 'a' and 'd' on the keyboard to move left or right and avoid colliding with obstacles.
- As the game progresses, the car's speed increases, increasing the chances of collision.
- Successfully avoiding an obstacle earns the player 1 point.
- Player 2 controls the red car with the left arrow and right arrow keys to move left or right and avoid obstacles.
- If a player runs into an obstacle, they stop playing. If both players collide, the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.
- Players can click speed up to speed up the movement of their car.
- After 10 seconds, the speed up effect will be gone, the cooldown lasts for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, users can click speed up again.

## Game Mechanics
### Player 1
- 'a': Move left
- 'd': Move right

### Player 2
- 'leftArrow': Move left
- 'rightArrow': Move right

### Start button: Start the game for both players.

## FUNCTIONALITY DESIGN

#### Custom Animations

- The user will move either the red car or the blue car by using the keyboard.
- We're using CSS transitions to smoothly animate the movement of the red and blue cars when the arrow keys are pressed. Here's how it works:

- We add an event listener to the keydown event, which listens for keyboard inputs.
When the left or right arrow key is pressed, or a or d on the keyboard is pressed, the respecting car will move.
- We then update the left or right CSS property to move the car smoothly to the desired position.
- The obstacles will drop 15px per 0.3 seconds, and its speed will increase as the game goes until reaches a speed limit of 50px per 0.3 seconds.
- We select the obstacle element using querySelector.
- We set an initial obstacle-dropping speed of 15 pixels per 0.3 seconds.
obstacle.style.top = parseInt(topVal) + gameSpeed + "px";
- The dropObstacle function is called at intervals using setInterval. It resets the obstacle's position to the top and increases its speed by reducing the transition duration.
- This creates an animation where obstacles drop down at an increasing speed over time.

If the obstacle goes beyond the boundary, it will go back to the top, visually people will feel that the old obstacle has passed, the new one has come.

#### Custom Interaction Mechanism

If your game involves moving and interacting elements, implement a custom collision detection mechanism.

The collision detection logic checks if the bounding rectangles of the cars and the obstacle overlap in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
If a collision is detected, that userâ€™s car will stop moving, the score will stop updating, and the game ends on his/her side.


#### Custom Algorithms
1. An algorithm to show the users who is the winner by comparing the scores between these two players.
2. A simple scoring algorithm that increases the score when a player successfully avoids an obstacle.

We initialize a score variable to keep track of the player's score.
The increaseScore function increases the score by 1 point whenever it's called.
The game calls this function whenever a player successfully avoids an obstacle to increase their score, and after that, html element will also get updated.
